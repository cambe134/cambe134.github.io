Hi let me introduce myself my name is Spencer. I decided long ago that I want to create games and apps. I made this decision when I was in 5th grade. I always loved the concept of creating something from scratch, but i never had the correct tools or knowledge for it. I did some reacher and coding came down to it as the key component in creating games. I want to pass this class with flying colors so I can finally live my life long dream!
