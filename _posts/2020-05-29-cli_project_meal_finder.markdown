My cli project is suppose to be a food finder. When you type in a certain meal name it will pop up with that meal type as in vegetarian or like italian stating the orgin or food group which it belongs to. It would also appear with a list of ingredients with instructions on the food, which would show on how to cook it for yourself. If the food isn't available it wound tell you to try again.
